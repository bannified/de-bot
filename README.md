# De-bot
A simple prototype chatbot that allows for consumers who are unable to fetch their delivery to inform courier and his/her company, allowing companies to avoid wasted trips due to failed deliveries.

- De-bot uses AfterYou's TofuSMS API https://tofusms.com
- Uses Google App Engine and Python 2.7
- Made during N-House Innovation Challenge 2017

Team consists of: Sharan Thangavel, Xiao De Long, Dominic Chong (@bannified)

Commands
==========
- `new` : Starts the conversation with De-bot
- `next` : Continues to the next part of the delivery process
- `0` : Simulates the cancellation of a delivery due to forseeable failed delivery

Also, the bot takes in ratings and remembers them if you successfully 'collected' your delivery!
